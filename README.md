# Hey, I'm Lucas ! 👋

I'm an open source enthusiast who spends my days building tools to make developers' lives easier. **My thing?** Creating fast, no-nonsense solutions—because coding should be fun, not frustrating.

### 🛠️ What I build
- **[Wabe](https://wabe.dev)**: A backend you can set up in minutes, with no vendor lock-in. Freedom matters.
- **[Wobe](https://wabe.dev)**: A modern, high-performance web framework. Simple. Fast. No unnecessary complexity.
- **Open source all the way**: I believe in sharing, collaborating, and making tech accessible to everyone.
