# Hey, I'm Lucas Coratger! 👋

I'm an open source enthusiast who spends my days building tools to make developers' lives easier. **My thing?** Creating fast, no-nonsense solutions—because coding should be fun, not frustrating.

### 🛠️ What I build
- **[Wabe](https://wabe.dev)**: A backend you can set up in minutes, with no vendor lock-in. Freedom matters.
- **[Wobe](https://wabe.dev)**: A modern, high-performance web framework. Simple. Fast. No unnecessary complexity.
- **Open source all the way**: I believe in sharing, collaborating, and making tech accessible to everyone.

### ⚡ Why I love open source
- **Speed**: I live for building things that just *work*—fast.
- **Community**: Learning from others, sharing ideas, and geeking out over code. That’s where the magic happens.
- **Impact**: There’s nothing better than seeing someone use your tool to bring their own ideas to life.

### 💬 Let’s chat!
- Want to **contribute** to Wabe or Wobe? I’d love to help you get started.
- Got a **project idea** or a technical question? Let’s talk!
- Just want to **nerd out** about tech or open source? I’m in.

**If you’re into coding, optimizing, or just making cool stuff, we’ve got plenty to talk about. 😊**
